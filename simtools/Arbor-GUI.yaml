- summary: |
    Arbor GUI is a comprehensive tool for building single cell models using Arbor.
    It strives to be self-contained, fast, and easy to use.

    - Design morphologically detailled cells for simulation in Arbor.
    - Load morphologies from SWC .swc, NeuroML .nml, NeuroLucida .asc.
    - Define and highlight Arbor regions and locsets.
    - Paint ion dynamics and bio-physical properties onto morphologies.
    - Place spike detectors and probes.
    - Export cable cells to Arborâ€™s internal format (ACC) for direct simulation.
    - Import cable cells in ACC format
