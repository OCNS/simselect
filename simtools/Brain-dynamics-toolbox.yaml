    The Brain Dynamics Toolbox is open-source Matlab software for simulating bespoke dynamical systems in neuroscience and beyond.
    Users define their system of equations as a custom matlab function.
    Interchangeable solvers and plotting tools can then be applied to that system with no additional programming effort.
