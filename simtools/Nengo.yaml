summary: Nengo is a Python library for building and simulating large-scale neural
  models. Nengo can create sophisticated spiking and non-spiking neural simulations
  with sensible defaults in a few lines of code. Yet, Nengo is highly extensible and
  flexible. You can define your own neuron types and learning rules, get input directly
  from hardware, build and run deep neural networks, drive robots, and even simulate
  your model on a completely different neural simulator or neuromorphic hardware.
