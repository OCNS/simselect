- summary: >
    NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop a language for describing detailed models of neural systems, which will serve as a standard data format for defining and exchanging descriptions of neuronal cell and network models. NeuroML is:


      - modular
      - standardised
      - structured


    and this allows you to:


      - easily build and optimise detailed models of neural systems
      - easily validate your models
      - easily visualise your models
      - easily simulate your models using a variety of simulators
      - easily analyse your simulations


    all using a well supported set of tools in the powerful Python programming language.
