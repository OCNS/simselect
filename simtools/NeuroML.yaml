summary: |
  NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop a language for describing detailed models of neural systems, which will serve as a standard data format for defining and exchanging descriptions of neuronal cell and network models. NeuroML is:

    - modular
    - standardised
    - structured

  and this allows you to:

    - easily build and optimise detailed models of neural systems
    - easily validate your models
    - easily visualise your models
    - easily simulate your models using a variety of simulators
    - easily analyse your simulations

  all using a well supported set of tools in the powerful Python programming language.
