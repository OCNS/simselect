summary: "Simulating the human brain is the holy grail of neuroscience - offering\
  \ a pioneering tool for understanding how our brain works and how to deal with its\
  \ disorders like stroke, epilepsy or neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's\
  \ or Parkinson's.\n\nWhile large-scale research initiatives simulate neurons and\
  \ small brain regions at the cellular level on massively parallel hardware, they\
  \ are still years away from clinical applications.\n\nThe Virtual Brain (TVB) takes\
  \ a different approach and reduces complexity on the micro level to attain the macro\
  \ organization. A TVB model of a patient's brain generates sufficiently accurate\
  \ EEG, MEG, BOLD and SEEG signals by reducing the complexity millionfold through\
  \ methods from statistical physics.\nThe key is TVB\u2019s hybrid approach of merging\
  \ individual anatomy from brain imaging data with state-of-the-art mathematical\
  \ modeling.\n"
