- summary: >
    Simulating the human brain is the holy grail of neuroscience - offering a pioneering tool for understanding how our brain works and how to deal with its disorders like stroke, epilepsy or neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.


    While large-scale research initiatives simulate neurons and small brain regions at the cellular level on massively parallel hardware, they are still years away from clinical applications.


    The Virtual Brain (TVB) takes a different approach and reduces complexity on the micro level to attain the macro organization: a TVB model of a patient's brain generates sufficiently accurate EEG, MEG, BOLD and SEEG signals by reducing the complexity millionfold through methods from statistical physics.
    The key is TVBâ€™s hybrid approach of merging individual anatomy from brain imaging data with state-of-the-art mathematical modeling.
