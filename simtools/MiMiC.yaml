- summary: |
    MiMiC is a framework for multiscale modeling in computational chemistry.
    The aim is to enable flexible and efficient implementations of multiscale simulation methods with support for multiple subsystems through coupling external programs.

    The MiMiC framework consists of the MiMiC library and the MiMiC communication library.
    Additionally, the MiMiCPy package can be used to assist in input preparation.
    MiMiC-based QM/MM runs efficiently in parallel using a combination of MPI and OpenMP parallelization.
