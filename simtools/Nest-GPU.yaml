- summary: >
    NEST GPU is a GPU-MPI library for simulation of large-scale networks of spiking neurons.

    With this library it is possible to run relatively fast simulations of large-scale networks of spiking neurons employing GPUs. For instance, on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU board it is possible to simulate the activity of 1 million multisynapse AdEx neurons with 1000 synapse per neuron in little more than 70 seconds per second of neural activity using the fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive stepsize as differential equations solver. The MPI communication is also very efficient. The Python interface is very similar to that of the NEST simulator: the most used commands are practically identical, dictionaries are used to define neurons, connections and synapsis properties in the same way.
