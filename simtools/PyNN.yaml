  - status: stable, maintained, actively developed
  - biological scale: point neurons, HH type with single and multiple compartments,
      (not sure if it supports NEURON's RxD)
  - network scale: single scale, small scale networks, meso scale networks
  - large scale implemented by: MPI? (not sure if it supports Brian/NEST/NEURON etc
      through MPI), Neuromorphic hardware
  - interface language: Python
  - model coverage: built-in models, extensible
  - file formats: null
  - comment: sits on top of multiple simulator backends, but one does not have to
      explicitly interact with the backends, so this should be included
