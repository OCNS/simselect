- summary: >
    Smoldyn is a computer program for cell-scale biochemical simulations.
    It simulates each molecule of interest individually to capture natural stochasticity and to yield nanometer-scale spatial resolution.
    It treats other molecules implicitly, enabling it to simulate hundreds of thousands of molecules over several minutes of real time.
    Simulated molecules diffuse, react, are confined by surfaces, and bind to membranes much as they would in a real biological system.


    Smoldyn is easy to use and easy to install.
    It is more accurate and faster than other particle-based simulators.
    Smoldyn's features include: simulations in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions, a "virtual experimenter" who can manipulate or measure the simulated system, molecules with excluded volume, rule-based modeling, and Python bindings.
