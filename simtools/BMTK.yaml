summary: "The Brain Modeling Toolkit (BMTK) is a python-based software package for\
  \ building, simulating and analyzing large-scale neural network models.\nIt supports\
  \ the building and simulation of models of varying levels-of-resolution; from multi-compartment\
  \ biophysically detailed networks, to point-neuron models, to filter-based models,\
  \ and even population-level firing rate models.\n\nThe BMTK is not itself a simulator\
  \ and will utilize existing simulators, like NEURON and NEST, to run different types\
  \ of models.\nWhat BMTK does provide:\n\n  - A unified interface across different\
  \ simulators, so that modelers can work with and study their own network models\
  \ across different simulators without having to learn how to use each tool.\n  -\
  \ An easy way to setup and initialize network simulations with little-to-no programming\
  \ necessary\n  - Automatic integration of parallelization when running on HPC.\n\
  \  - Extra built-in features which the native simulators may not support out-of-the-box.\n\
  \nThe BMTK was developed and is supported at the Allen Institute for Brain Science\
  \ and released under a BSD 3-clause license.\nWe encourage others to use the BMTK\
  \ for their own research, and suggestions and contributions to the BMTK are welcome.\n"
