summary: |
  The Brain Modeling Toolkit (BMTK) is a python-based software package for building, simulating and analyzing large-scale neural network models.
  It supports the building and simulation of models of varying levels-of-resolution; from multi-compartment biophysically detailed networks, to point-neuron models, to filter-based models, and even population-level firing rate models.

  The BMTK is not itself a simulator and will utilize existing simulators, like NEURON and NEST, to run different types of models.
  What BMTK does provide:

    - A unified interface across different simulators, so that modelers can work with and study their own network models across different simulators without having to learn how to use each tool.
    - An easy way to setup and initialize network simulations with little-to-no programming necessary
    - Automatic integration of parallelization when running on HPC.
    - Extra built-in features which the native simulators may not support out-of-the-box.

  The BMTK was developed and is supported at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and released under a BSD 3-clause license.
  We encourage others to use the BMTK for their own research, and suggestions and contributions to the BMTK are welcome.
