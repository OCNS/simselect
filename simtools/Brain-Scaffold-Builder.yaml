- summary: >
    The Brain Scaffold Builder (BSB) is a black box component framework for multiparadigm neural modelling: we provide structure, architecture and organization, and you provide the use-case specific parts of your model.
    In our framework, your model is described in a code-free configuration of components with parameters.


    For the framework to reliably use components, and make them work together in a complex workflow, it asks a fixed set of questions per component type: e.g. a connection component will be asked how to connect cells.
    These contracts of cooperation between you and the framework are called interfaces. The framework executes a transparently parallelized workflow, and calls your components to fulfill their role.


    This way, by implementing our component interfaces and declaring them in a configuration file, most models end up being code-free, well-parametrized, self-contained, human-readable, multi-scale models!
