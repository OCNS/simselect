summary: 'The Brain Scaffold Builder (BSB) is a black box component framework for
  multiparadigm neural modelling: we provide structure, architecture and organization,
  and you provide the use-case specific parts of your model.

  In our framework, your model is described in a code-free configuration of components
  with parameters.


  For the framework to reliably use components, and make them work together in a complex
  workflow, it asks a fixed set of questions per component type: e.g. a connection
  component will be asked how to connect cells.

  These contracts of cooperation between you and the framework are called interfaces.
  The framework executes a transparently parallelized workflow, and calls your components
  to fulfill their role.


  This way, by implementing our component interfaces and declaring them in a configuration
  file, most models end up being code-free, well-parametrized, self-contained, human-readable,
  multi-scale models!
