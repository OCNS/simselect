- summary: |
    Brian2CUDA is a Python package for simulating spiking neural networks on graphics processing units (GPUs).
    It is an extension of the spiking neural network simulator Brian2, which allows flexible model definitions in
    Python. Brian2CUDA uses the code generation system from Brian2 to generate simulation code in C++/CUDA, which is
    then executed on NVIDIA GPUs.
