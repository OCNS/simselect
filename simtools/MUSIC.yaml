summary: 'MUSIC is an API allowing large scale neuron simulators using MPI internally
  to exchange data during runtime.

  MUSIC provides mechanisms to transfer massive amounts of event information and continuous
  values from one parallel application to another.

  Special care has been taken to ensure that existing simulators can be adapted to
  MUSIC.

  In particular, MUSIC handles data transfer between applications that use different
  time steps and different data allocation strategies.
