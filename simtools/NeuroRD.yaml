summary: |
  NeuroRD is a computationally efficient, stochastic reaction-diffusion simulator (pronounced NeurRDS) used mostly for simulating neuronal signaling pathways.
  This is a Java program which runs on any platform.
  The algorithm is based on Gillespie's tau-leap reaction algorithm, and the stochastic diffusion algorithm of Blackwell.
  It uses XML-based model specifications.
