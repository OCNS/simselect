- summary: >
    NeuroRD is a computationally efficient, stochastic reaction-diffusion simulator (pronounced NeurRDS) used mostly for simulating neuronal signaling pathways.
    This is a Java program which runs on any platform.
    The algorithm is based on Gillespie's tau-leap reaction algorithm, and the stochastic diffusion algorithm of Blackwell.
    It uses XML-based model specifications.
