summary: 'NESTML is a domain-specific language for neuron and synapse models. These
  dynamical models can be used in simulations of brain activity on several platforms,
  in particular the NEST Simulator. NESTML combines an easy to understand, yet powerful
  syntax; a flexible processing toolchain, written in Python; and good simulation
  performance by means of code generation (C++ for NEST Simulator).
