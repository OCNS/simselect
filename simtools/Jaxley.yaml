summary: 'Jaxley is a differentiable simulator for biophysical neuron models, written
  in the Python library JAX. Its key features are:


  - automatic differentiation, allowing gradient-based optimization of thousands of
  parameters

  - support for CPU, GPU, or TPU without any changes to the code

  - jit-compilation, making it as fast as other packages while being fully written
  in Python

  - support for multicompartment neurons

  - elegant mechanisms for parameter sharing
