This folder contains one file for each simulator. The file `simtools.yaml` is
ignored. (It is a file with information that was gathered previously and is now
replaced by the  individual files. As soon as all the information is
transferred, the file will be deleted.)

The file for each simulator should have a name that is the same as the (short) name
of the simulator, replacing spaces with hyphens. Each file is a `YAML` file with the following
structure (additional fields not mentioned below will be ignored; the values
shown below are obviously example values) â€“ the file shown here should be named `sim.yaml`,
corresponding to its `short_name`. The `short_name` field is optional, most tools would only have
a `name`, which then also determines the file name:

```yaml
name: Simulator Name
short_name: sim
features: frontend, simulator
operating_system: Linux, MacOS
biological_level: Population Model, Single-Compartment (Simple) Model, Single-Compartment (Complex) Model, Multi-Compartment Model
processing_support: Single Machine, Cluster, Supercomputer, GPU
interface_language: Python
model_description_language: NeuroML/LEMS
summary: This simulator is very good.

release:
  source: pypi
  package_name: pysim
  version: 1.1.2
  published: '2025-03-26'
relations:
  - name: Another simulator
    description: exports to
  - name: Yet another simulator
    description: imports from
```
The fields `features`, `operating_system`, `biological_level`,
`processing_support`, `interface_language`, and `model_description_language`
are comma-separated strings (i.e. not yaml lists).

The `features` fields should contain one or more of the following values: `frontend` (for
interfaces to simulation engines), `simulator` (for simulation engines), `standard`
(for interoperability standards, APIs, etc.), or `tool` (for a general tool).
Only tools that are simulators should contain the `biological_level` field.

The `urls` field contains entries that will be displayed as button labels. The
following names are recognized: `homepage`, `documentation`, `installation`, `tutorial`,
`examples`, `email`, `chat`, `forum`, `issue tracker`, `source`, `download`.
The `email` field  should refer to  an email address (which will be converted
into a `mailto:` link), all other fields should give a full URL.

The `release` section describes the last release. There are currently three possibilities:
1. Python packages published on [pypi](https://pypi.org) should use `source: pypi` and specify
   a `package_name`, if the name on pypi is not identical to the `short_name`/`name`.
2. Tools that are published as GitHub releases should use `source: github` and specify the name
   of the repository as `repository: user-or-org/respository`
3. Tools that are published neither on pypi nor on GitHub need a manual `version` and `published`
   field, stating the most recent version and its publication date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

For pypi and GitHub releases, versions and publication date will be updated automatically every night
(or by manually triggering the "Update Releases" action).

Relations are a relationships between tools. The mentioned `name` needs to
match the `name` of another simulator in the directory. The `description` of
the relationship is currently a free-form string.
