- summary: >
    CoreNEURON is designed as a library within the NEURON simulator and can transparently handle all spiking network simulations including gap junction coupling with the fixed time step method.
    In order to run a NEURON model with CoreNEURON, MOD files should be THREADSAFE; If random number generator is used then Random123 should be used instead of MCellRan4; POINTER variables need to be converted to BBCOREPOINTER.
