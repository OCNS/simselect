### Contribution notes
Please install the necessary linters/pre-commit hooks using the `requirements-dev.txt` file:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

To set up pre-commit, please run (only needed once):

```
pre-commit install
```

Now, the pre-commit checks will be run before each commit.
